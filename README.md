# Monster Problem


There is a monster holding you and 8 other people captive the monster will pick a number between 1 and 100 whoevers number is closest to the monster gets eaten if you tie with another person the monster will eat you

the 8 other people guess first and say their guesses out loud then its your turn you goal is to pick the most optimal number that will result in the highest survival rate for you


# Solving

You must write the algorithim for you solution in the Solution.java file in the safest_pick method

the safest_pick method should always return a number between 1-100 

the max paramater will allways be 100 in the method

the otherPlayersPicks method will allways be an array of 8 random integers from 1-100

you may see the methods we use to check your solution in the app.java file
